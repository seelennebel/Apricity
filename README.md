# Apricity
### Apricity project description
A small website that I created to bring clarity on what words people hear mostly while listening to their favorite songs. It has a main page and the form page where users can submit lyrics of their favorite artists. Then, the website will show a word cloud consisting of the 20 words with the highest occurrence rate.
### What I used to create the website
I created the web application using Python Flask. The word_cloud.py module is the crucial code for creating the data that will be later displayed as the word cloud.
### What I learned from this project
1. Handling HTTP requests (POST and GET) with Flask
2. Rendering HTML "templates" with some passed data from Flask
3. Using own written modules to work with user input data
4. Creating simple markups with HTML
5. Developing the website responsibly by using CSS features such as Flexbot, Grid, and CSS functions
6. Adding a custom font to the project so that it would be accessible even if the user doesn't have it installed
7. Hosting my web application with heroku
### What are my plans for this project
I am planning to make the website more user-friendly in the future. Also, I want to scale up the application so that it will be able to hold and process a large amount of user data. Later, it can be used to display a big word cloud of many people's favorite songs. Also, I would like to change the design of the word cloud and make it interactive.
