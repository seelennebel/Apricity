# Apricity
Apricity project

A small website that I created to bring clarity on what words people hear mostly while listening to their favourite songs. I created the web application using Python Flask. The frontend of the website looks very sharp and undone. Please, let me take my time to polish the frontend and later we will see a great looking website!
